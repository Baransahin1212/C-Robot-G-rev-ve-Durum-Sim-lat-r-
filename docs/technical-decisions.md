# Technical Decisions

Short rationale for the notable design decisions made while building
RobotSimulator, written for a reviewer who wants to know *why*, not just
*what*. See [`references.md`](references.md) for sources consulted.

## Modern C++

The codebase targets C++17 and actually uses the following, rather than
claiming a generic "modern C++" label:

- **Classes with one focused responsibility each** — `RobotStateMachine`
  only decides transitions, `JsonScenarioSource` only parses JSON into
  `Event`s, `Simulator` only orchestrates, `StreamSimulationLogger` only
  formats log lines, `StreamReportWriter` only formats a report. See the
  [architecture section](../README.md#architecture) of the README.
- **`enum class`** for `RobotState`, `EventType`, `TransitionResult`,
  `LogLevel`, `MissionOutcome`, `ArgumentAction` — scoped, strongly typed,
  no implicit conversion to `int`.
- **References for dependency injection** — `Simulator` takes
  `IEventSource&`, `RobotStateMachine&`, and an optional
  `ISimulationLogger*`; `StreamSimulationLogger`/`StreamReportWriter` take
  `std::ostream&`. Everything is a non-owning reference or pointer supplied
  by the caller, never constructed internally.
- **`std::optional`** — `Event::value` (a event may or may not carry a
  numeric payload), `SimulationResult::lastEventTimestampMs`, the
  `std::optional<JsonScenarioSource>` used in `Application.cpp` to defer
  construction until after a `try`/`catch`.
- **`std::filesystem`** — creating the `logs/`/`reports/` output
  directories and building paths in `Application.cpp`.
- **RAII / standard-library resource management** — `std::ifstream`,
  `std::ofstream`, `std::vector`, `std::string`, `std::optional` all manage
  their own resources; there is no manual `new`/`delete` anywhere in the
  codebase.

## FSM implementation choice

Alternatives considered for `RobotStateMachine`:

- **Large procedural logic with scattered `if` statements** — rejected;
  hard to verify all transitions are covered, easy to introduce silent
  gaps.
- **State Pattern (one class per state)** — rejected for this project's
  scale. With 9 states and ~10 event types, a class hierarchy would add
  indirection (virtual dispatch, one file per state) without a matching
  benefit; it also fights against keeping transition rules in one place
  that's easy to audit against a spec.
- **Third-party FSM library** — rejected; the transition table is small
  and stable, and a dependency here would obscure exactly the logic a
  reviewer most needs to read directly.
- **Centralized explicit FSM (`switch` on state, nested `switch` on event)**
  — chosen. Every transition is one `case` in one function
  (`RobotStateMachine::processEvent`), which is easy to read top-to-bottom,
  easy to diff against [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md), and easy to
  unit test exhaustively (all 21 `RobotStateMachineTest` cases enumerate
  specific `(state, event) -> state` outcomes). For a project whose primary
  goals are readability and testability rather than supporting dozens of
  states, this was the better fit.

## Event-driven design

```text
Event source (IEventSource) -> Event -> Simulator -> RobotStateMachine
```

`Simulator::run()` pulls one `Event` at a time from an `IEventSource` and
hands it to `RobotStateMachine::processEvent()`. The state machine never
reaches out and asks for input; it only reacts to what's handed to it. This
keeps the FSM a pure function of `(current state, event) -> new state` with
no knowledge of where events come from — a scenario file today, potentially
something else tomorrow (see below).

## Interface and abstraction: `IEventSource`

```cpp
class IEventSource {
public:
    virtual ~IEventSource() = default;
    virtual std::optional<Event> nextEvent() = 0;
};
```

`JsonScenarioSource` is the only implementation that exists today. The
interface exists so `Simulator` depends on an abstraction, not a concrete
JSON reader — `Simulator`'s constructor takes `IEventSource&`, and nothing
in `robot_core` includes JSON headers.

**Not implemented**, but explicitly enabled by this interface as future
extensibility: a `RealSensorEventSource` or `NetworkEventSource` could
implement `IEventSource::nextEvent()` by reading from real hardware or a
network socket, and `Simulator`/`RobotStateMachine` would not need to
change at all. This is a design property demonstrated by the interface
boundary, not a shipped feature.

## Sensor/decision separation

`JsonScenarioSource` (in `robot_scenario`) only converts a JSON file into a
sequence of `Event` objects. It does not know what `RobotState::Moving`
means, does not call `RobotStateMachine::processEvent`, and does not decide
what the robot should do — it would be exactly as valid a design if the
events it produced were consumed by something other than a robot
simulator.

Conversely, `RobotStateMachine` (in `robot_core`) has no `#include` of
`nlohmann/json.hpp` and no knowledge that its events might have originated
from a file at all. `robot_core`'s CMake target has no dependency, direct
or transitive, on the JSON library.

This split means the JSON schema can change without touching FSM logic,
and the FSM's transition rules can change without touching the parser —
each has exactly one reason to change.

## JSON vs CSV

JSON was chosen over CSV for the scenario format because:

- **Structured, nested data** — an event is naturally a small object
  (`type`, `timestamp_ms`, optional `value`), not a flat row. Representing
  an optional field in CSV means either a fixed empty column or a
  variable-width row format, both worse than JSON's native `"value"?`.
- **Optional numeric values** — `BatteryCritical` carries a `value`; most
  other events don't. JSON expresses "this key is absent" directly;
  in CSV every row needs the same column count, so the value column would
  have to always exist with some placeholder for "no value" (e.g. empty
  string), and the parser would need to reintroduce whatever null-marker
  convention we invented.
- **Extensibility** — adding a new optional field (a second sensor value,
  a text note, a source identifier) later is a non-breaking, additive JSON
  change. In CSV it would require re-deciding column order/count and
  updating every existing file.

CSV is not impossible for this problem — a fixed, well-specified CSV
schema with a sentinel for "no value" would work — but it was a worse fit
given the schema already needed one optional field and might reasonably
need more, and JSON's tooling (nlohmann/json) made structured validation
straightforward.

## Error handling

Three genuinely different kinds of failure are kept separate on purpose:

1. **`ScenarioParseError`** (thrown by `JsonScenarioSource`) — the input
   file could not be opened, was not valid JSON, or did not match the
   scenario schema (missing/wrong-typed fields, unknown event type). This
   represents *inability to construct a valid scenario at all*, which is
   an exceptional, all-or-nothing failure — the whole file is validated
   eagerly in the constructor before any event is returned.
2. **Application/I/O errors** (`std::runtime_error`, caught in
   `Application.cpp`) — a log or report output file could not be opened
   for writing. Also exceptional: the process cannot do its job without
   writable output.
3. **`TransitionResult::InvalidTransition`** (returned, never thrown, by
   `RobotStateMachine::processEvent`) — an ordinary, expected outcome. A
   scenario routinely sends events the current state doesn't handle (see
   `invalid_transition.json`), and that is not a programming error or a
   reason to unwind the stack — it's exactly the kind of result a caller
   is expected to branch on. Exceptions are reserved for "this run cannot
   proceed"; a rejected transition is "this run continues, with one
   recorded rejection." `Simulator::run()` counts it in
   `SimulationResult::rejectedTransitions` and keeps processing subsequent
   events, and the CLI's exit code stays `0` for a scenario that completes
   with rejected transitions (see the [README](../README.md#exit-codes)).

## Logging

`ISimulationLogger` defines three specific methods —
`logEventReceived`, `logTransitionSucceeded`, `logTransitionRejected` —
rather than one generic `log(string)` call, so message *formatting* stays
inside the concrete logger and `Simulator` never builds log strings itself.
`StreamSimulationLogger` is the one implementation, writing to a
caller-supplied `std::ostream&` — this lets the exact same class log to
`std::cout`, an `std::ofstream` (the real `logs/simulation.log`), or an
`std::ostringstream` (used throughout the test suite so tests never touch
the filesystem). The logger is optional: `Simulator` takes a nullable,
non-owning `ISimulationLogger*` defaulting to `nullptr`, so callers that
don't care about logging (most unit tests) aren't forced to supply one.

## Unit testing

The project uses [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
(fetched via CMake `FetchContent`, pinned to tag `v1.15.2`) and
[CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html) as the
test runner. As of this writing, `ctest -C Debug -N` discovers **77
automated tests** (verified immediately before writing this document — see
the [README testing section](../README.md#testing) for the exact command).

The suite is organized by what it exercises, not by arbitrary grouping:

- **FSM unit tests** (`RobotStateMachineTests.cpp`) — every transition in
  `state-machine.md`, plus invalid-transition and terminal-state rejection.
- **Simulator tests** (`SimulatorTests.cpp`) — use a hand-written
  `FakeEventSource` implementing `IEventSource` entirely in memory, so
  `Simulator`'s orchestration logic (counters, logging calls,
  `lastEventTimestampMs`) is tested independently of JSON parsing.
- **Logging tests** (`StreamSimulationLoggerTests.cpp`) and **reporting
  tests** (`SimulationReportTests.cpp`) — verify formatted output via
  `std::ostringstream`.
- **JSON parser tests** (`JsonScenarioSourceTests.cpp`) — valid parsing
  plus every documented validation failure, using small fixture files
  under `tests/fixtures/`.
- **Final scenario integration tests** (`ScenarioIntegrationTests.cpp`) —
  run the real `scenarios/*.json` files through the actual
  `JsonScenarioSource -> Simulator -> RobotStateMachine` chain.
- **Application/CLI tests** (`ApplicationTests.cpp`) — drive
  `robot::app::runApplication()` directly with in-memory streams and a
  build-tree-local output directory, so CLI behavior (help, argument
  errors, exit codes) is tested without spawning a subprocess or touching
  the real `logs/`/`reports/` directories.

## Fail-safe / emergency stop

The simulator implements a simplified software model of fail-safe
behavior, entirely at the FSM level:

- `EmergencyStop` transitions to `EmergencyStopped` from every supported
  active state (`Moving`, `WaitingForObstacleClear`, `ReturningHome`).
- `InvalidSensorData` transitions to `Error` from the same three active
  states — representing "sensor input can no longer be trusted, stop
  making decisions on it."
- There is **no automatic transition out of `EmergencyStopped`**. Nothing
  in `RobotStateMachine` moves the robot back to `Idle` on its own after an
  emergency stop.
- `Reset` is the only way out of `EmergencyStopped` or `Error`, and it must
  be sent explicitly — the scenario (or, in a future integration, an
  operator) has to say so.

**This is a software simulation of fail-safe *concepts* for a
demonstration/educational project. It is not a safety-certified industrial
robot controller, has not been through any functional-safety assessment
(e.g. IEC 61508 / ISO 13849), and must not be used as, or represent, a real
safety system.**
